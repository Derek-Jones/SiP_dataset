## The SiP dataset

The data is described in the paper:
[A conversation around the analysis of the SiP effort estimation dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.01621.pdf) by Derek M. Jones and Stephen Cullum.


Blog post [What is known about software effort estimation in 2024](https://shape-of-code.com/2024/03/10/what-is-known-about-software-effort-estimation-in-2024/).

The Projects chapter of my book, [Evidence-based Software Engineering](http://knosof.co.uk/ESEUR/), analyses the publicly available data on the subject; [code+all data](https://github.com/Derek-Jones/ESEUR-code-data).

If you make use of this data in a paper, please let us know.

[Fullstack D3 and Data Visualization](https://wattenberger.com/blog/d3-interactive-charts) by Amelia Wattenberger, uses the SiP dataset in example plots.
